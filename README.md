Bio-DB-Das-BioSQL
======================

These modules provide a DasI API to BioSQL (see http://biosql.org). With this package you can use 
BioSQL as a backend database for JBrowse (see http://jbrowse.org).

This supercedes version .03 in CPAN, which is missing a number of useful methods and can not
be used with JBrowse.
